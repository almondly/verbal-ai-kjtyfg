The `useAI` hook will need to be updated to predict the next word based on the current sentence.\n\nTo control the TTS behavior, the `PhraseBar` component's `onSpeak` function should be the only trigger for `expo-speech`. Remove any TTS calls that occur during text input or phrase construction.\n\nThe issue with the TTS pronunciation of \"I\" might require some investigation. It could be a configuration issue with the `expo-speech` library or a quirk of the specific TTS engine being used.

Let's address this issue and ensure a polished user experience. To effectively fix the layout, I need to understand the specifics of what's broken. However, I can provide general guidance and potential areas to investigate.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential issues and how to approach them:\n\n1.  **Screen Responsiveness:**\n    *   Check for hardcoded dimensions. Ensure that components adapt to different screen sizes using `flex` properties and percentage-based dimensions instead of fixed pixel values.\n    *   Utilize `SafeAreaView` to avoid overlapping with device notches or status bars, especially on iOS.\n\n2.  **Styling Conflicts:**\n    *   Inspect for conflicting styles defined in `styles/commonStyles.ts` or within individual components.\n    *   Use the React Native debugger or Expo DevTools to inspect element styles and identify overrides.\n\n3.  **Component-Specific Issues:**\n    *   Carefully examine the styles in `CommunicationGrid.tsx`, `TileItem.tsx`, `CategoryBar.tsx`, and `SuggestionsRow.tsx`, as these are central to the app's layout.\n    *   Verify that the `categories` data and `defaultTiles` data are correctly structured and not causing rendering issues.\n\n4.  **Dependency Problems:**\n    *   Ensure all dependencies, especially `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `expo-speech`, and `react-native-svg`, are correctly installed and compatible with your Expo version (53).\n\n5.  **Error Logging:**\n    *   Check the `utils/errorLogger.ts` for any logged errors that might indicate layout-related issues.\n\nTo further assist, please provide specific details about the layout problems you're encountering. Screenshots or descriptions of the broken elements would be very helpful.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T01:03:53.834596"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/CommunicationGrid.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/TileItem.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/CategoryBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/SuggestionsRow.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/PhraseBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/SettingsSheet.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "hooks/useAI.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "hooks/useLibrary.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/categories.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/defaultTiles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/Button.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/DonutProgress.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/errorLogger.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/Icon.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "babel.config.js", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app.json", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "metro.config.js", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "tsconfig.json", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I found and fixed a key cause of the broken layout: Safe Area usage was incorrect in RootLayout (using useSafeAreaInsets outside of SafeAreaProvider).

I'll need to examine the code, particularly `app/index.tsx` and `app/_layout.tsx`, to pinpoint the cause. It could be a style issue, a data loading problem, or a component rendering failure.\n\n2.  **Verify Core Component Rendering:** Ensure that the main components like `CategoryBar`, `CommunicationGrid`, `PhraseBar`, and `SuggestionsRow` are rendering correctly.\n\n3.  **Apply Category Colors to Tiles:** Modify the `TileItem.tsx` component to dynamically apply the neon colors based on the tile's category. This will likely involve accessing the `categories` data and mapping tile categories to their corresponding colors.\n\n4.  **Preserve Layout and Positioning:** Ensure that any changes made to fix the white screen or apply the new colors do not disrupt the existing layout and positioning of elements. This will require careful attention to the styling in `styles/commonStyles.ts` and the inline styles used in the components.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-18T18:03:18.612831"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the white screen issue while preserving all the existing layout and colors, and apply the neon category colors to the tiles.
