The `useAI` hook will need to be updated to predict the next word based on the current sentence.\n\nTo control the TTS behavior, the `PhraseBar` component's `onSpeak` function should be the only trigger for `expo-speech`. Remove any TTS calls that occur during text input or phrase construction.\n\nThe issue with the TTS pronunciation of \"I\" might require some investigation. It could be a configuration issue with the `expo-speech` library or a quirk of the specific TTS engine being used.

Let's address this issue and ensure a polished user experience. To effectively fix the layout, I need to understand the specifics of what's broken. However, I can provide general guidance and potential areas to investigate.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential issues and how to approach them:\n\n1.  **Screen Responsiveness:**\n    *   Check for hardcoded dimensions. Ensure that components adapt to different screen sizes using `flex` properties and percentage-based dimensions instead of fixed pixel values.\n    *   Utilize `SafeAreaView` to avoid overlapping with device notches or status bars, especially on iOS.\n\n2.  **Styling Conflicts:**\n    *   Inspect for conflicting styles defined in `styles/commonStyles.ts` or within individual components.\n    *   Use the React Native debugger or Expo DevTools to inspect element styles and identify overrides.\n\n3.  **Component-Specific Issues:**\n    *   Carefully examine the styles in `CommunicationGrid.tsx`, `TileItem.tsx`, `CategoryBar.tsx`, and `SuggestionsRow.tsx`, as these are central to the app's layout.\n    *   Verify that the `categories` data and `defaultTiles` data are correctly structured and not causing rendering issues.\n\n4.  **Dependency Problems:**\n    *   Ensure all dependencies, especially `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `expo-speech`, and `react-native-svg`, are correctly installed and compatible with your Expo version (53).\n\n5.  **Error Logging:**\n    *   Check the `utils/errorLogger.ts` for any logged errors that might indicate layout-related issues.\n\nTo further assist, please provide specific details about the layout problems you're encountering. Screenshots or descriptions of the broken elements would be very helpful.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T01:03:53.834596"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/CommunicationGrid.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/TileItem.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/CategoryBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/SuggestionsRow.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/PhraseBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/SettingsSheet.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "hooks/useAI.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "hooks/useLibrary.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/categories.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/defaultTiles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/Button.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/DonutProgress.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/errorLogger.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/Icon.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "babel.config.js", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app.json", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "metro.config.js", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "tsconfig.json", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I found and fixed a key cause of the broken layout: Safe Area usage was incorrect in RootLayout (using useSafeAreaInsets outside of SafeAreaProvider).
