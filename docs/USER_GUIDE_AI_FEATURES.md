## Overview
The communication app now includes powerful AI features that learn from your usage and help you communicate faster and more effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Word Suggestions
As you build sentences, the app suggests relevant words based on:

### 2. Full Sentence Predictions
The app can predict complete sentences from just 1-2 words!

**Example**:
- Tap "I" + "want" → Suggests "I want to go outside", "I want to eat", "I want to play"

**How to Use**:
- Full sentence suggestions appear with a blue background
- They show "Full Sentence" label at the bottom
- Tap to use the entire sentence at once

### 3. Tense Switching
Easily change verbs between present, past, and future tense!

**Example**:
- "eat" → "ate" (past) or "will eat" (future)
- "go" → "went" (past) or "will go" (future)
- "play" → "played" (past) or "will play" (future)

**How to Use**:
- Long press on any verb suggestion
- A tense switcher will appear
- Tap the tense you want (Present, Past, or Future)
- The old word is automatically replaced
