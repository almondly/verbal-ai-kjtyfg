# What's New - User-Facing Changes

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Smoother Scrolling
The app now scrolls much more smoothly, even with lots of tiles. We've optimized how tiles are displayed so your device doesn't have to work as hard.

**What you'll notice:**
- No more lag when scrolling through tiles
- Faster loading when switching categories
- App uses less memory overall

---

## 📝 Better Text Size

### Easier to Read Tiles
The text on tiles is now slightly smaller, which makes it fit better and look cleaner.

**What you'll notice:**
- Text fits better within tiles
- No more cramped or overlapping text
- More balanced appearance

---

## 🔊 Distinct Voice Options

### Girl and Boy Voices Sound Different Now
Previously, the girl and boy voices sounded too similar. Now they use completely different voice systems.

**What you'll notice:**
- **Girl Voice**: Sounds clearly feminine (uses voices like Samantha, Karen)
- **Boy Voice**: Sounds clearly masculine (uses voices like Aaron, Alex)
- **Neutral Voice**: Balanced, clear voice for general use

**How to change voices:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Tap on "Voice Settings"
3. Select Girl, Boy, or Neutral
4. Tap "Test Voice" to hear the difference

## 🤖 Smarter AI Recommendations

### "am" Now Appears After "I"
The AI now correctly suggests "am" when you type "I". This was a critical fix for grammatical correctness.

**What you'll notice:**
- Type "I" → See "am" in the suggestions
- Type "He" → See "is" in the suggestions
- Type "She" → See "is" in the suggestions
- Type "You" → See "are" in the suggestions
- Type "We" → See "are" in the suggestions
- Type "They" → See "are" in the suggestions

**Other improvements:**
- More grammatically correct suggestions overall
- Better prioritization of common words
- Faster suggestion generation
