# Quick Start Guide - Improved AI Sentence Completion

## What's New?

Your AI assistant is now **much smarter** at predicting what you want to say! Here's what improved:

### 1. Connecting Words Appear More Often ✨

Words like **"am"**, **"the"**, **"is"**, **"are"** now appear when they should:

- Type **"I"** → See **"am"** first
- Type **"I want"** → See **"to"**, **"the"**, **"a"**
- Type **"he"** → See **"is"** first
- Type **"she needs"** → See **"her"**, **"help"**, **"to"**

### 2. Better Context Understanding 🧠

The AI now understands sentence structure:

- Knows when you need a verb
- Knows when you need an article ("the", "a")
- Knows when you need a preposition ("to", "with", "for")
- Suggests grammatically correct completions

### 3. Google-Style Predictions 🌐

The AI uses web intelligence to finish sentences naturally:

- Type **"I want to go"** → Suggests **"outside"**, **"home"**, **"to school"**
- Type **"I need help with"** → Suggests **"my homework"**, **"this"**, **"eating"**
- Type **"Can I have"** → Suggests **"water"**, **"food"**, **"help"**

## How to Use

### Starting a Sentence

1. **Type or select the first word** (e.g., "I")
2. **Look at the suggestions** - connecting words like "am", "want", "need" appear first
3. **Select the word** that fits what you want to say
4. **Continue building** - the AI adapts to your sentence

### Building a Sentence

1. **Watch the suggestions change** as you add words
2. **Connecting words appear automatically** when grammatically appropriate
3. **Full sentence suggestions** appear for common phrases
4. **Select any suggestion** to add it to your sentence

### Using Categories

1. **Select a category** (e.g., "food", "actions", "feelings")
2. **Suggestions adapt** to show category-relevant words
3. **Connecting words still appear** to help build sentences
4. **Switch categories** anytime to access different vocabulary
